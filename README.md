🕵️‍♂️ KenShin – A Fake News Detection Model

KenShin is a user-friendly web application designed to detect fake news and provide accurate predictions in real-time.
The name KenShin is inspired by a Japanese word meaning: “Seeker of Truth”.

This project is a step towards combating the spread of misinformation online and helping users verify the authenticity of news.

💻 Project Overview

KenShin combines frontend and backend technologies to deliver a seamless and interactive experience:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript

Backend: Python, Flask, Machine Learning (NLP, Regression)

The website is designed to be responsive and intuitive, making it accessible desktop.

Prediction & Result pages

Integrated Machine Learning backend for fake news detection using Flask

Predicts whether a news article is real or fake

🕵️‍♂️ Detection Features

Our system uses multiple layers of analysis to ensure accurate results:

Source Verification
Cross-references with a database of over 50,000 news sources to evaluate reliability and historical accuracy.

Model accuracy: ~71%

Content Analysis
Uses natural language processing (NLP) to detect misleading language, sensationalism, and logical inconsistencies.

Fact Database Comparison
Compares claims against an extensive fact database with millions of verified data points.

Author Reputation
Evaluates the author’s history and credibility based on past publications and fact-checks.

🌐 Live Demo

Since GitHub cannot run Python or Flask apps, this project is deployed using Render.
